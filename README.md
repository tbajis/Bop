# Bop for iOS

This repository contains the source code for Bop, an iOS application written in Swift built with [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io).  

Bop is a fun way to search Foursquare venues with a particular interest theme. Start by choosing from interest categories including "Sports", "Music", "Food", "Art", "Fashion" and "Culture." Browse Twitter updates and images for specific venues in a detail view.

## Fabric
Bop uses many of the features available in Fabric, including Crashlytics, Answers, Sign In with Twitter and Phone Number via Digits, and embedded Timelines with the TwitterKit.

## Foursquare
Bop uses the [Fousquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to search for venues using an interest keyword and geographic location. Photos are downloaded using venues unique "ID" parameter from Foursquare.
